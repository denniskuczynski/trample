= trample

02/14/2012 -- Fork Notes.  This is a fork of the original Trample code base by James Golick, extended to add a couple of new features


Trample is a flexible load simulation tool. 

Most load sim tools make requests to a static list of urls. They spawn n threads and make requests to the urls on the list in succession, in each thread. Unfortunately, though, if your applicaition makes use of any kind of caching (including your database's internal caching facilities), this kind of load simulation is unrealistic.

The data required to serve a single set of urls is likely to fit nicely in the database server's cache (even on a small server). So, having a single user hammer a finite set of pages will make your application look much faster than it really is.

Trample allows you to provide parameter values inside of a block (a lambda function, for non-rubyists). The block is executed each time the parameters are needed. So, if you use randomization in the block, you should (theoretically) get different values every time.

That way, you can have trample log in as several different users and request different data in each session.

= Installation

git clone git://github.com/jumph4x/trample.git

cd trample/

gem install jeweler

gem build trample.gemspec

gem install trample-0.1.0.gem

gem install sevenwire-rest-client --source http://gems.github.com

gem install log4r

gem install hpricot


= How To

Trample uses a ruby DSL for configuration.
  
  Trample.configure do
    concurrency 5
    iterations  10
    delay 1
    timeout 5
	request_filter &Trample::RailsHandler::request_filter
	response_processor &Trample::RailsHandler::response_processor
    login do
      post "http://yoursite.com/login" do
        {:username => User.random.username, :password => "swordfish"}
      end
    end
    get  "http://yoursite.com/somewhere"
    post "http://yoursite.com/something" do
      {:a_parameter => "a value"}
    end
    get  "http://yoursite.com/someresources/:id" do
      {:id => SomeResource.random.id}
    end
  end

The above configuration will,
- start 5 (concurrency) sessions 
- with a (delay) of 1 second between each session
- any requests taking longer than 5 seconds (timeout) are marked as timed out in the logs
- by logging in as a random user at the url in the (login) block. 
- Then, it'll hit the two urls underneath it 10 (iterations) times during each session.

To run trample, save your configuration somewhere and run:

  trample start /path/to/your/trample/config.rb
